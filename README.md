# AlphaStep

## Description
A custom step-fitting program using Python 3.9 and various libraries. Includes a GUI using PySimpleGUI. This program includes methods for smoothing data such as Savitzky-Golay and Moving Window Averages. There are also optimizations to allow for more precise fitting of steps which are both positive and negative occuring transiently. 

## Instructions
Both the AlphaStepBackend.py and AlphasStepGUI.py must be downloaded. Then simply edit the analysis file directory in the gui program to where you have it on your machine. Then run the GUI program.

## Disclaimer
This is a major work in development and it progresses/improves as I do. The comments throughout the backend need to be expanded on and cleaned up. The GUI is still under heavy development to create a better experience for the end user and basically has no comments right now. Please meter expectations, but rest assured the code works as it currently is. I test and use the code in JupyterLab and the Spyder IDE.

## Contributions
The code is based on Dr. Ian Morgan's StePy repository (found [here](https://github.com/ianlmorgan/StePy)). 

All major modifications so far have been developed by me, Dillon Balthrop. The GUI was also coded by me.
